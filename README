This is a KDE plasmoid that shows facebook notifications
from the RSS feed of notifications from your facebook account.

It sits in the panel, and pops up if there is a new notification.
Clicking on a notification will open the relevant facebook page
in user's default browser.
Fun-fact: Clicking on the title in the plasmoid will take you
straight to facebook.com in your browser!

=INSTALL=========

Before you can use the plasmoid, make sure you have following
dependencies:

Build deps:
- KDE Development library (either from Git or precompiled package from your distribution)
- Qt Development library (this is a dependency for above, and hence will mostly be installed automatically)

Runtime deps:
- KDE Plasma Workspace (to load the plasmoid on!)

To install the plasmoid, build (and install) by following
commands:

$ cd facebook-notifier/
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr .. && make
$ su -c 'make install'
$ kbuildsycoca4

If there were no errors during build, the plasmoid should be
ready to use and can be loaded from KDE Plasma Workspace as usual.

=USAGE==========

After the plasmoid is added, go to "Facebook Notifier Settings" by
right-clicking on the plasmoid, and enter your facebook account's
RSS feed URL for notifications. To get the feed URL, open your facebook
account in a browser, open your notifications and go to "See All
Notifications". On the page that opens, find the line "Get notifications
via:" and copy the link address of the link "RSS" on that line.
Paste the URL in plasmoid's settings box and click OK. This is a
one-time procedure (whenever you add the plasmoid) and the notifications
will be synced on your desktop with an interval of one minute.
