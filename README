This is a KDE plasmoid that shows facebook notifications
from the RSS feed of notifications from your facebook account.

It sits in the panel, and pops up if there is a new notification.
Clicking on a notification will open the relevant facebook page
in user's default browser.
Fun-fact: Clicking on the title in the plasmoid will take you
straight to facebook.com in your browser!

=INSTALL=========

Make sure you are running the KDE SC version >= 4.8.

First make the plasmoid package from source:

$ cd facebook-notifier-kde-plasmoid/
$ zip -r ~/fbnotifier.plasmoid *

This will make a plasmoid package in a file name 'fbnotifier.plasmoid'
in your home directory.
Now simply to go "Add Widgets" from the cashew in panel or desktop
menu, and choose "Get New Widgets..." -> "Install Widget From Local File".
Browse to the fbnotifier.plasmoid file and select it.
The plasmoid will be installed (even if the it gives an error) and can
now be added to the desktop/panel from the widgets list.

=USAGE==========

After the plasmoid is added, go to "Facebook Notifier Settings" by
right-clicking on the plasmoid, and enter your facebook account's
RSS feed URL for notifications. To get the feed URL, open your facebook
account in a browser, open your notifications and go to "See All
Notifications". On the page that opens, find the line "Get notifications
via:" and copy the link address of the link "RSS" on that line.
Paste the URL in plasmoid's settings box and click OK. This is a
one-time procedure (whenever you add the plasmoid) and the notifications
will be synced on your desktop with an interval of one minute.
